# ReAct Loop Agent Pattern

## Pattern Overview
The ReAct (Reason-Act-Observe-Think) loop agent provides a structured approach to agent reasoning with explicit steps:
1. **Reason**: Analyze current state and determine action
2. **Act**: Execute the determined action
3. **Observe**: Gather results from action execution
4. **Think**: Reflect and plan next steps

## Key Components
- `react_loop.py`: Main implementation with structured reasoning cycle
- `main_v2.py`: Enhanced agent with integrated ReAct capabilities
- State management for tracking reasoning steps
- Tool recovery mechanisms integrated into the loop

## Integration Points
- Used by debug command for agent analysis
- Compatible with existing main agent interface
- Extensible for different reasoning patterns

## Reliability Considerations
- Each step is explicitly tracked and logged
- Error recovery built into each phase
- Timeout handling for long-running reasoning cycles
