# Document configuration as utils-level

Formalize that configuration/ module is utils-level (read-only static data), not core-level. Update architecture docs and dependency graph to mark these imports as valid.

## Acceptance Criteria

Architecture decision documented in CLAUDE.md. layers.dot shows configuration edge as valid.
