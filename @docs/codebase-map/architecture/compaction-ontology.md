# Compaction Ontology

## Overview
This document provides an overview of the compaction process and its role in the system.

## Key Concepts
- **Compaction**: The process of optimizing and organizing data to improve efficiency.
- **Ontology**: A formal representation of knowledge as a set of concepts and relationships.

## Architecture
The compaction process involves several components:
- **Data Collector**: Gathers data for compaction.
- **Processor**: Optimizes and organizes the data.
- **Storage**: Stores the compacted data efficiently.

## Design Decisions
- **Efficiency**: The compaction process is designed to minimize resource usage while maximizing performance.
- **Scalability**: The system is built to handle large datasets without compromising speed.

## Examples
- Example 1: Compacting a large dataset to reduce storage requirements.
- Example 2: Optimizing data retrieval by reorganizing indices.

Why did the computer go to therapy?
Because it had too many bytes of emotional baggage!
