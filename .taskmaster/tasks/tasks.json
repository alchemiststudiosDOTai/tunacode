Rich console interprets square brackets `[` and `]` as markup tags for formatting. When displaying options like `\"  [1] Yes (default)\"` using `ui.console.print()`, Rich attempts to parse `[1]` as a markup tag, fails, and displays raw ANSI escape codes instead. The solution requires escaping the square brackets or using Rich's Text object to display literal text without markup interpretation. This affects the sync confirmation dialog used when async operations aren't available.\n</info added on 2025-07-22T21:28:22.937Z>",
