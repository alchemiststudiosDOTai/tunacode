# Test All Tool Confirmations

## Summary of Tool Confirmation Status

All TunaCode tools now have confirmation dialogs with 1/2/3 options:

### 1. **write_file** ✅

- Shows content preview in code block
- Asks for confirmation before creating/overwriting files
- YOLO mode skips confirmation

### 2. **update_file** ✅

- Shows visual diff between old and new content
- Uses color-coded diff display (red for removed, green for added)
- Parameters properly mapped (target/patch) for UI

### 3. **run_command** ✅

- Shows the command to be executed
- Includes timeout parameter if specified
- Confirmation prevents accidental dangerous commands

### 4. **read_file** ✅

- Shows filepath to be read
- Less critical but still respects confirmation settings
- YOLO mode skips confirmation

## How Confirmations Work

```python
# Each tool checks before execution:
if not _handle_confirmation("tool_name", args):
    raise Exception("User rejected the operation")
```

## Options Available

1. **Yes (default)** - Execute this command
2. **Yes, and don't ask again** - Always allow this tool type
3. **No** - Reject and abort the operation

## Testing Instructions

1. Run `tunacode`
2. Ask the agent to create a file - you'll see write_file confirmation
3. Ask to update a file - you'll see the diff view
4. Ask to run a command - you'll see the command confirmation
5. Try `/yolo` mode - all confirmations will be skipped

## Example Commands to Test

```
# Test write_file
"Create a hello.txt file with 'Hello World' content"

# Test update_file
"Change 'Hello World' to 'Hello TunaCode' in hello.txt"

# Test run_command
"List all files in the current directory"

# Test read_file
"Show me the contents of hello.txt"
```
