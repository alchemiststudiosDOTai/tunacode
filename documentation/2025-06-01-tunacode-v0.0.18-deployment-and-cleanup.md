## Work Completed

### 1. **Professional Message Updates** (Start of session)

- Changed "Pfft, boring..." → "Tool confirmations re-enabled for safety."

### 2. **Test Suite Fixes**
- Identified skipped async tests due to missing `pytest-asyncio` dependency
- Installed `pytest-asyncio` and added `@pytest.mark.asyncio` decorators

### 5. **Git Branch Cleanup** (End of session)
