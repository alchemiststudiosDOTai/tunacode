# Summary of All Fixes - 2025-06-16

## 1. StateManager AttributeError Fix
- **Problem**: `'StateManager' object has no attribute 'model'`
- **Solution**: Changed to `state_manager.session.current_model` in adaptive_orchestrator.py
- **Documentation**: 2025-06-16-architect-mode-state-manager-fix.md

## 2. Architect Mode Write Operations Fix
- **Problem**: All operations used ReadOnlyAgent, couldn't create/modify files
- **Solution**: 
  - Added `mutate` field to TaskSchema
  - Updated HybridRequestAnalyzer to set mutate=True for write operations
  - Added regex patterns for write/create commands
- **Documentation**: 2025-06-16-architect-mode-write-fix.md

## 3. CRUD Test Scenarios
- **Created**: test_architect_crud_scenarios.py
  - Test 1: Create-then-Read (Happy Path)
  - Test 2: Update-with-Diff (Idempotent Modification)
  - Test 3: Read-Then-Summarize (Hybrid Fallback Trigger)
  - Test 4: Delete-and-Gracefully-Fail Read
- **Created**: test_regular_mode_crud_scenarios.py
  - Same four tests adapted for regular mode
  - Includes mock agent responses and timing metrics

## Key Insights

The architect mode bugs revealed important architectural details:
- StateManager has a nested SessionState structure
- Task execution relies on the `mutate` field to choose agents
- The hybrid analyzer needs to properly annotate tasks with metadata
- Write operations need explicit patterns for deterministic parsing

All fixes maintain backward compatibility while restoring full CRUD functionality.
