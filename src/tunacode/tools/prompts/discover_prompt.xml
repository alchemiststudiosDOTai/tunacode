Find and map code related to a concept, feature, or module.

Describe what you're looking for in natural language. The tool extracts search
terms, generates glob patterns, reads file previews, scores relevance, and
returns a compact structured report.

USE THIS TOOL instead of manually chaining glob, grep, and read_file when
you need to understand where a concept lives in the codebase.

Examples:
- "where is auth handled"
- "database schema and migrations"
- "tool registration and execution pipeline"
- "how does compaction work"
- "error handling and retry logic"

The report includes:
- File clusters grouped by directory
- Relevance markers (high/medium)
- Key symbols (functions, classes) per file
- Import dependencies
- Compact excerpts of the most relevant lines
- A file tree of relevant paths

Parameters:
- query (required): Natural language description of what to find
- directory (optional): Project root to search from (default: current directory)

Returns up to 20 most relevant files. For broad queries, narrow your
description to get more focused results.
