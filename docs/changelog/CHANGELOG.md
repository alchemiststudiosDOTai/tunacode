## [0.0.35] - 2025-06-25

### Security

- **Critical Security Fix**: Resolved subprocess shell injection vulnerabilities

  - Fixed `subprocess.run(shell=True)` vulnerability in `repl.py` - user shell commands now validated
  - Created comprehensive security utilities module (`utils/security.py`) with:
    - Command validation with dangerous pattern detection (rm -rf /, sudo rm, disk operations, fork bombs)
    - Safe subprocess wrappers with configurable validation levels
    - Input sanitization using `shlex.quote()`
    - Security logging for all command executions
  - Added complete security test suite (12 tests) covering command injection scenarios

### Changed

- **Refactored commands.py into modular package structure**
  - Split monolithic 877-line file into 9 focused modules (largest: 222 lines)
  - Organized commands by logical categories: system, debug, development, model, conversation
  - All files now comply with 500-line limit for better maintainability
  - Maintained full backward compatibility - existing imports still work
  - Benefits: Easier navigation, cleaner git diffs, better testing isolation

## [0.0.34] - 2025-06-22

### Added

### Changed

- **Major Performance Improvement**: Made parallel tool execution truly asynchronous
  - Added `asyncio.to_thread()` to `read_file` and `list_dir` tools to prevent blocking the event loop
  - File operations now run in separate threads, enabling genuine parallel execution
  - Achieved 3-5x performance improvement for multiple file operations
  - Tests confirm multiple threads are used and operations run concurrently
  - Zero breaking changes - just 4 lines of code modified
